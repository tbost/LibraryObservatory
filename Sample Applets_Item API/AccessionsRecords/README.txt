DESCRIPTION


PROCESS

Note: Records published during the last ten years (the same years for which accession date is provided) have been intentionally excluded as they dominate the dataset and overwhelm much of the historical informaiton.


TO DO
- Add explanation text on first load
- Allow toggling between different faceting after having download data for the given date
- Make Facet Legend somehow representative of total items in each facet
- Allow pan-able timeline
