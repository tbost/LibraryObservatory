DESCRIPTION
Library Observatory is an on-going project at metaLAB, based at Harvard University, exploring the materiality of literature via large-scale metadata visualization.  The initiative is interested specfically in exploring the materiality of literature and literature production, including for example such areas as the developent of early movable type, variations of physical format, language, or paper type, and the evolution of library collecting practices.  Further, the project is interested in how such qualites change over time, geography, subject matter, individuals, or genres.  The project is both a free-standing research initiative unto itself as well as in support of several course being taught across the university in affiliation with metaLAB.  While there are other initiatives at the lab to explore these areas at the scale of the individual object, Library Observatory aims to complement that investigative research with a macro-scale lens on the study of literature's materiality.  Currently the project centers for the most part on the analysis of the recently publically-released metadata for the vast and representative Harvard Libraries collection, but it also seeks to expand that resources with many other similar bibliographic data resources both within and withou the university.
